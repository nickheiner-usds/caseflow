[32m    always increments attempts counter[0m

WARNING: Using the `raise_error` matcher without providing a specific error or message risks false positives, since `raise_error` will match when Ruby raises a `NoMethodError`, `NameError` or `ArgumentError`, potentially allowing the expectation to pass without even executing the method you are intending to call. Actual error raised was #<RuntimeError: test>. Instead consider providing a specific error class or message. This message can be suppressed by setting: `RSpec::Expectations.configuration.on_potential_false_positives = :nothing`. Called from /home/travis/build/department-of-veterans-affairs/caseflow/spec/jobs/job_prometheus_metric_middleware_spec.rb:28:in `block (3 levels) in <top (required)>'.
